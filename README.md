## Overview

It is a tool that allows novice penetration testers and script kiddies to learn while using Kali linux, using commands, simple investigations, enumerations and attacks with keypad operations implemented in PAKURI.

### What's KaliPAKU

I call it "KaliPAKU" with a hint of irony, since it looks like a tool I made myself, using tools included in Kali Linux and adding a little PAKURI control.
Incidentally, "karipaku" in Japanese slang indicates embezzling something borrowed.
> 借りパク (rōmaji karipaku)
> To take something borrowed and make it one's own property. Or to have it done to you by the other party.
> [Wikitonary:かりぱく](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%8B%E3%82%8A%E3%81%B1%E3%81%8F "かりぱく")

## Description

KaliPAKU is a semi-automated, user-friendly framework for penetration testing tools. Using only the keypad, you can use the penetration test tool like a game.
It's also a great introductory tool for beginners. Learn the flow of penetration testing with KaliPAKU without having to wrestle with confusing command lines and tools.
